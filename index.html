        <h3>Bio</h3>
        
        <p>Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Developed from an earlier group, the Rain, the band originally consisted of Liam Gallagher, Paul Arthurs, Paul McGuigan, and Tony McCarroll.
            Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album <em>Definitely Maybe (1994)</em>. The following year the band recorded <em>(What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995)</em> with drummer Alan White, in the midst of a chart rivalry with Britpop peers Blur. (What's the Story) Morning Glory? became one of the best-selling albums of all time, and the Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. Oasis' third album, <em>Be Here Now (1997)</em>, went on to be the fastest-selling album of all time in Britain at the time upon release.
            However, in August 2009 the band abruptly split up after the departure of Noel.
